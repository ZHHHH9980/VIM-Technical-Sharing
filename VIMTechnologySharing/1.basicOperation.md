# VIM

Notice: if you use Codesandbox use `jk` to Back to Normal mode.

## 1. Normal mode 

### 1.0 Basic operation (Semantic Operations)

           [i ↑  Up]

[j ← Left] [k ↓ Down] [l → Right]

f -> find

y -> yank

p -> paste

g -> go

o -> open (a new line)

u -> undo

d -> delete

c -> cut

The difference between delete & cut is that cut enters Insert mode

#### 1.0.0 Line Operation: Operator doubling

yy -> yank a line

dd -> delete a line

cc -> cut a line (and change to insert mode)

gg -> go to the first line

#### 1.0.1 Combine with {{count}}

1. Relative line number with i/j

{{n}} + i/j

2. Absolute line number with gg 

{{n}} + gg

3. Delete/yank/cut {{count}} lines

{{n}} dd/yy/cc

#### 1.0.3 Combine with Text Object

1. Yank/delete/cut word (yw/dw/cw) 

```
             dw
             ↓
Before: HelloWorld 
After:  Hello
```

2. Yank/delete/cut inside (a) word (yiw/diw/ciw)

```

                 diw
                  ↓
 Before: 'internationalization'  
 After:  ''

                 yiw
                  ↓
 Before: 'internationalization'  
 After:  'internationalization' internationalization
```

#### 1.0.2 The Uppercase to enhance/reverse the action

##### Reverse

find: <- F f ->

go to the last/first line: G/gg

open a new line: o/O

##### Enhance

The power of diW

```python

# diW delete word and adjacent symbols

# Before:
                          diW
                            ↓
from storage import localStorageUtil, sessionStorageUtil

# After:
from storage import sessionStorageUtil
```

Jump multiple lines down/up at once

K -> ['k','k','k','k','k','k','k','k','k','k','k']
I -> ['i','i','i','i','i','i','i','i','i','i','i']

Y: Yank the buffer to system clipboard

#### Magic sign %

Jump to the matching symbol

```js
JSON.stringify({
  a: 1,

  c: 3,
});
```
