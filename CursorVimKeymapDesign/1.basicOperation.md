# 1.0 Basic operation (Semantic Operations)

## 1. Normal mode 

The origin key mapping about cursor movement is not that intuitive, so I change it to the following:

```
Before ✅:
[h ← Left] [j ↓  Down] [k ↑  Up] [l → Right]
```

```
After:
           [i ↑  Up]
[j ← Left] [k ↓ Down] [l → Right]
```

### 1.0 Composition of Vim Commands

Vim commands are composed of three parts: 

[count] + verb + object

where count (optional) specifies how many times the operation should be performed.

### 1.1 Verb (Semantic Operations)

y -> yank

p -> paste

d -> delete

c -> cut

The difference between delete & cut is that cut enters [Insert mode].

f -> find

g -> go

o -> open (a new line)

u -> undo


#### 1.2 Relative line number movement with [i ↑  Up][k ↓ Down]

```
:set relativenumber # enable relative line number

[ count ] + i/j
```

#### 1.3 Cook verb with Text Object

1. Yank/delete/cut word (yw/dw/cw) 

```
             dw
             ↓
Before: HelloWorld 
After:  Hello
```

2. Yank/delete/cut inner (a) word (yiw/diw/ciw)

```

                 diw
                  ↓
 Before: 'internationalization'  
 After:  ''

                 yiw (and paste)
                  ↓
 Before: 'internationalization'  
 After:  'internationalization' internationalization
```

#### 1.4 Line Operation: Operator doubling

The original mapping is like y_, d_, c_, gg, etc. In order to make it more convenient, Vim just double the verb, which is an abbreviation.

yy -> yank a line

dd -> delete a line

cc -> cut a line (and change to insert mode)

gg -> go to the first line

#### 1.0.2 Uppercase Commands: Extended and Reversed Actions

##### Reversed Direction Commands
- `F` vs `f`: Find in opposite directions
- `G` vs `gg`: Go to last/first line
- `O` vs `o`: Open new line above/below

##### Enhanced Operations

`W` - Operates on WORDS (including adjacent punctuation)

go to the last/first line: G/gg

open a new line: o/O

Example of diW (delete inner WORD):
```python
# diW delete word and adjacent symbols
# Before:
                          diW
                            ↓
from storage import localStorageUtil, sessionStorageUtil

# After:
from storage import sessionStorageUtil
```

#### 1.5 Jump multiple lines down/up at once

In order to follow uppercase is that enhanced, that's my personal preference:

```
K -> ['k','k','k','k','k','k','k','k','k','k','k']

I -> ['i','i','i','i','i','i','i','i','i','i','i']
```

#### 1.6 Yank the buffer to system clipboard

In order to follow uppercase is that enhanced, that's my personal preference:

y: normal y is just yank the current object into [a] register (my default register)

Y: Yank the buffer to system clipboard
